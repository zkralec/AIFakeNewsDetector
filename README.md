# AI Fake News Detector
Built an ML pipeline using Python and scikit-learn to classify political statements as fake or real using the LIAR dataset. I was able to preprocess data, apply TF-IDF vectorization, and train a logistic regression model achieving ~62% accuracy. I explored deep learning approaches (LSTM/TF) for future extension.
