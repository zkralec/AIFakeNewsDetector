# AI Fake News Detector
A machine learning model that classifies political statements as either fake or real using the LIAR dataset. I built a full pipeline in Python using pandas and scikit-learn â€” preprocessing the data, vectorizing the text with TF-IDF, and training a logistic regression model that reached about 62% accuracy. I also started experimenting with TensorFlow to explore deep learning versions of the project.
